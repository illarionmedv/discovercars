# Coding Task for Discovercars :red_car:
The most difficult part of the code task was to figure out how to combine Jquery and Vue in one project and make sure that they do not conflict with each other. If there were no terms of use for Jquery, I would write a project on the Vue CLI as always, but in this case I decided yo use Vue CDN. I also looked at the app prototype at Figma and understood that it would be cool if the authentication form would be actually working so I decided to build a back-end part as well. I'm happy with the final result because the app is running the same as a prototype. 

I worked on the project for three days or 10 hours in total.

## Technologies
The client part is building using Gulp

Sign in form is validated by Jquery and it sending requests to API through AJAX

Sign up form is validated by Vue and it sending requests to API through axios

Back end server is running on Express + MongoDB


## :fire:Useful tips
Run back-end server
```bash
npm run server
```
Run fron-end side from 'client' folder
```bash
gulp
```

## P.S.
Thank you for the interesting and unusual task that made me think. It was fun to do :grinning:
